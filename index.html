      <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
        I am a junior majoring in IT Management with a Business Analytics concentration and a minor in computing and digital technologies with a specialization in cyber security at The University of Notre Dame.

        Beginning midway through my freshman year, I was involved with the marketing and launch aspect of Crcl App, and not only was able to compound the data analytics skills I have learned in the classroom and apply my training to a real business situation, but also learned a great deal about startups and technology firms in general. The startup was a small company, which allowed me more autonomy and power over business decisions. This gave me management and business teamwork experience which could not have been found in a typical freshman year internship. Working with this startup, I spoke at and attended many key meetings with managers of successful technology firms, giving me insight to complex problems and technological solutions which can be applied to consulting problem-solving skills. During my time at Peoples Bank, I was treated as a full-time employee, and developed skills in programing, imaging, installation, and general IT services. In addition to these skills, I gained insight into how the implementation of technology affects business functions and acquired knowledge on cyber security systems and practices.

        This past summer I worked in the Notre Dame Investment office. This was a unique opportunity to see first-hand how complex investment decisions are made, and enabled me to further learn to apply my research and Excel capabilities to real decision making. While not directly technology related, through this experience I learned a great deal regarding the application of my hard skills in decision making, a lesson which is directly applicable and vital to consulting. A large trend for all companies is cyber security, and my existing knowledge and first-hand experience can be applied to consulting with any company on this newly emerging, crucial issue.
